# Courses-taken
I had the opportunity to take several science classes on top of my computational coursework because of my early interest in medicine. I can approach computational biology projects from a molecular science standpoint with expertise to analyze heterogeneous biological datasets and build robust computational pipelines. This allows me to connect with experimentalists and bioinformaticians/statisticians and collaborate on interdisciplinary projects.
